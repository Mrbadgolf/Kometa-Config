# Kometa Configs

This is where you'll find all my config files related to Kometa. I've included an example of how you could fire off each overlay in my example config [exampleConfig.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/s0len/meta-manager-config/main/exampleConfig.yml).

## Movies

Below you'll find the yaml config which then if used will generate the image below.

### Creates two collections which replace Plex default "New Releases" collection for Movies

These collections are a substantial improvement upon Plex defaults. New Releases shows Movies which has been added in the last 92 days to the Library AND has been Released in the last 365 days. This means in this collection you will always find the freshest media available.
Old Movies Just Added however is a collection of Movies who has been Released more then 365 days ago AND has been added to the Library in the last 30 days. This means in this collection you will find all the Movies which has just recently been added to the Library but has been around for longer then a year.

```yaml
- url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/s0len/meta-manager-config/main/collection_files/better_new_and_old_movie_releases.yml
```

### Common Sense Collection with custom posters

Creates collections for all your media inside the library and sorts it according to the age restriction based on Common Sense.

```yaml
    - default: content_rating_cs
      template_variables:
        use_separator: false
        collection_mode: hide
        url_poster: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/s0len/meta-manager-config/main/posters/commonsense/<<key>>.jpg
```

### Creates a ribbon style background in the top left corner with a width of 313 pixels

**Keep in mind**, it has to be run before any overlay which is supposed to be on top of the background**

### Fallback Network logo

This is a bit of a workaround to fill up the missing network logos by first writing a plex logo on all overlays. Then AFTER this is run we run the below `default: network` so that it is overwritten by default: network if it finds an image for the network.
**Must run before `default: network`.**

```yml
      - url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/s0len/meta-manager-config/main/overlays/network_fallback.yml
```

### Network the show originated from in the top left corner

## Formula 1 Title Cards posters

Perfect if you're using Sonarr to download sports and this one in particular is for Formula 1 where we add nice title cards for each episode and also add them into a collection to separate all episodes by round.

### Requirements

- Sonarr with Formula 1 added as a show
- TrashGuides setup
- Plex needs to use TVDB as the library Agent (selected inside Advanced under edit library)

```yaml
  Sports: # Your library name where your Sports shows from Sonarr is located
    collection_files:
    - url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/s0len/meta-manager-config/main/collection_files/formula1_2024.yml
    metadata_files:
    - url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/s0len/meta-manager-config/main/metadata_files/formula1_title_cards_2024.yml
    operations:
      assets_for_all: true

## MotoGP Title Cards posters

## Formula 1 poster overlay (deprecated)

Complete config for Formula 1 with awesome posters. Be sure to read through the requirements.

### Requirements

First off you need to create a filesystem which mirrors the below example. The libary name does **not** have to be `Formula 1` but it needs to be standalone. This means in this library there will __only__ be formula 1 episodes. 
The folder you mount to this libary has to contain the season you want to show. The config works for 2023 and 2024 currently so add two folders under your main folder (the one which is mapped to this libary). Then name the first folder `Formula1 2023` and the second `Formula1 2024` these names can __NOT__ be changed and need to be exactly this. 
Under each of these folders you will then add a folder for each round. What's required is that the folder **has** to start with <<round_number>>. In the below example i also add the name if the round, just to make it easier to see which is helpful.
Under each `round folder` you will place each media file (episode) you want to be able to watch. Each episode has to contain the following: `<<round_number>>x<<episode_number>> <<type_of_episode>>`
`episode number` does not need to match something, it just has to match in chronological order which means episode 1 can not be Free Practise 2 if you're going to add Free Practise 1 as well.
`type of episode` has to contain what type of episode this is. For example `FP1` or `Free Practise 1` are both good examples of valid types.

```txt
Formula 1                                  -> Library Folder
└── Formula1 2023                           -> Folder for each F1 Season
    └── 04 - Azerbaijan GP                -> Folder for each Race in a season
        ├── 04x01 - Azerbaijan GP - Pre-Qualifying Buildup.mkv
        ├── 04x02 - Azerbaijan GP - Qualifying Session.mkv
        ├── 04x03 - Azerbaijan GP - Post-Qualifying Analysis.mkv
        ├── 04x04 - Azerbaijan GP - Ted's Qualifying Notebook.mkv
        ├── 04x05 - Azerbaijan GP - Pre-Sprint Shootout Buildup.mkv
        ├── 04x06 - Azerbaijan GP - Sprint Shootout Session.mkv
        ├── 04x07 - Azerbaijan GP - Post-Sprint Shootout Analysis.mkv
        ├── 04x08 - Azerbaijan GP - Pre-Sprint Race Buildup.mkv
        ├── 04x09 - Azerbaijan GP - Sprint Race Session.mkv
        ├── 04x10 - Azerbaijan GP - Post-Sprint Race Analysis.mkv
        ├── 04x11 - Azerbaijan GP - Ted's Sprint Notebook.mkv
        ├── 04x12 - Azerbaijan GP - Pre-Race Buildup.mkv
        ├── 04x13 - Azerbaijan GP - Race Session.mkv
        ├── 04x14 - Azerbaijan GP - Post-Race Analysis.mkv
        └── 04x15 - Azerbaijan GP - Ted's Race Notebook.mkv
```

After your filesystem is setup you also need to make sure that your Plex media agent is set to __PERSONAL__ as otherwise this will not work.

The last thing you need to do is to add the relevant yaml to your `config.yml` please se below example.

### This is the yaml for your config.yml
